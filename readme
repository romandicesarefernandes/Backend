controllers/: Store controller files that contain business logic and handle HTTP requests and responses.
models/: Keep database models here if your project involves a database. These models define how data is structured in your application.
middleware/: Place middleware functions, which are functions that can process requests before they reach route handlers.
routes/: Define route files to separate different API endpoints or web routes. This keeps your code modular and easy to maintain.
node_modules/: This folder is created when you install dependencies using npm. It contains all the packages and modules required for your project. You typically don't need to modify anything in this folder.
.git/ (if using Git): If you're using version control with Git, this folder stores Git's configuration and repository data. It helps you track changes and collaborate with others.
.env (Optional): Consider including a .env file to manage environment variables such as API keys and sensitive information. This file should be kept out of version control for security reasons.
package.json and package-lock.json: These files contain project metadata and dependencies. package.json is typically generated during the initialization of your project, and package-lock.json locks down the versions of your dependencies.
server.js (or app.js): This file serves as the entry point for your Node.js and Express application. It sets up the server and defines the server logic.
Static Assets (Optional): If your application serves static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images, you can create a directory for them (e.g., public/ or static/) to keep them separate from your application logic.
